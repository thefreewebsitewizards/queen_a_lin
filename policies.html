                    <p><strong>DEPOSITS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.</strong> Deposits will be applied towards the final cost of your tattoo at your final session unless your deposit is forfeited. Deposits are forfeited if you no-show for an appointment, cancel with less than 48 hours advance notice, reschedule more than twice, arrive for an appointment more than 30 minutes late, arrive for an appointment without proper ID or arrive intoxicated or otherwise unable to be tattooed, request excessive or last minute changes to the design or concept, do not complete your tattoo within two years, or decide not to get tattooed at all.

                    <h3>üé® Artwork Policy</h3>
                    <p>We will not email, text, or preview a custom design for your review until your scheduled appointment. Any revisions that stay within the idea discussed at the consultation can be made on the day of your appointment. If you change your idea, size, placement, concept, etc and major or excessive revisions are required, your deposit will be forfeited and your appointment will need to be rescheduled and a new deposit may be required.</p>

                    <h3>üîß Touch Up Policy</h3>
                    <p>Courtesy touch ups are at the discretion of the tattoo artist. Necessary touch ups related to the technical application and healing of a tattoo are free if done within 6 months of the tattoo and by the original artist who did the tattoo (unless the tattoo is on a non-guaranteed body part, see below). Touch ups cannot be done until the tattoo is fully healed. Touch ups due to client failure or negligence to follow our aftercare procedures are not free and will be charged the same rate as a new tattoo. Changes to the original agreed upon tattoo are not considered a touch up and will be charged as a new tattoo.</p>
                    <p><strong>HEALING RESULTS OF TATTOOS ON THE HEAD, FACE, GENITALS, FEET, OR HANDS (INCLUDING FINGERS) CANNOT BE GUARANTEED AND MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE TOUCH UPS.</strong> If your tattoo is on a non-guaranteed body part it will probably need multiple touch ups and may be charged as a new tattoo each time.</p>

                    <h3>üíµ Minimum Charge Policy</h3>
                    <p>Our shop minimum covers the time and expense of a sanitary set up and clean up of the equipment and procedure area as well as single use supplies necessary to provide a clean and safe tattoo applied by an experienced professional. Our minimum is the absolute lowest amount we will charge for any tattoo. This applies per person getting tattooed, per session. If you are getting a tattoo of one tiny dot, the cost will be the minimum. If you and a friend are getting matching tiny dot tattoos, the cost for each of you will be the minimum each. If you want multiple tiny tattoos on your body at the same tattoo session, you will be charged a flat rate or hourly (so if you want multiple tiny tattoos, it is more cost effective for you to get more than one at a time). Please note that any tattoo that takes more than 30 minutes will automatically cost more than the minimum.</p>

                    <p><strong>NO REFUNDS</strong> for any reason. In the unlikely event of a mistake it is the duty of the artist to fix it for free. There is always something we can do. Please contact the studio as soon as possible to allow us to find the best & quickest solution.</p>
